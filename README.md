## Steps 1: Get your project set-up
You have two ways of working on your project: Local and Gomix.

### Local development
1. Clone the repo.
1. Create a `env.sh` file that contains:

    ```
    export MONGODB_URI='YOUR URI';
    export SECRET='YOUR SECRET'
    ```

1. Run `source .env`, and you are good to go!
